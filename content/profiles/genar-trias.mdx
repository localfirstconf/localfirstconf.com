Fullstack Engineer interested in new software architectures that allow a better user and developer experiences. 
I work at Factorial on the Developer Experience team, providing tools and abstractions to other teams. 
In my free time, I build an offline-first music player, [deplayer](https://gitlab.com/deplayer/deplayer).
