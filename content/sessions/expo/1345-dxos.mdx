Composer is an open source collaborative “super-app” that enables small teams to switch from using expensive and fragmented SaaS applications to a simple modular user interface that they are free to extend and customize. Composer runs on the DXOS decentralized platform, which includes ECHO — a scalable realtime graph database that works with Automerge and Effect schema. Composer is designed for developers, researchers, product managers, and other knowledge workers and makes it easy to collaborate with disparate and remote teams.

In this talk, we will demonstrate how to use the Composer SDK along with open source models to build personalized AI agents that can interact with external systems — and your data — without compromising your privacy. We will introduce DXOS Functions — a serverless API that lets developers build data processing workflows that are interoperable with existing DXOS applications and new custom components.
